# Rock_Paper_Scissors
/* initial README.md removed locally 
This project is from The Odin Project Foundations course
there are 12 exercises in the JavaScript section.
Instructions are to develop a simple implementaton of the rock-paper-scissors game. 
I am new to learning JavaScript and Git and GitHub so this is an exercise in learning multiple steps in programming.
I will revisit this exercise as I learn.*/
